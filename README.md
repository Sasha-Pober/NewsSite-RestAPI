The RESTFul Web API project, which I developed for the implementation of a news site, which allows you to publish, edit and view news by headings, tags and date they were created.
I used several technologies, such as ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework. Also, I have used design patterns (Repository, Unit of Work, Specification) and architectural pattern MVC.
